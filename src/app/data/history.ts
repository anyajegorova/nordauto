  content: `
    Founded in 1998, NordAuto began as a small family-run garage with a passion for cars and a commitment to honest service. Over the years, our team of dedicated mechanics has grown, but our values remain the same: quality workmanship, transparency, and customer care.
    
    From humble beginnings, we have expanded our services to include advanced diagnostics, modern repair techniques, and a customer lounge. Our mechanics regularly attend training to stay up-to-date with the latest automotive technologies. We take pride in every vehicle we service, treating each as if it were our own.
    
    Today, NordAuto is trusted by generations of drivers. Whether itâ€™s a routine oil change or a complex engine repair, our story is built on reliability, expertise, and a genuine love for automobiles.
